# Suzuki Group Class Ideas

## Purpose

This site is meant to help Suzuki Violin teachers think and plan group classes by providing fun and engaging games for the group to play. Currently these games and techniques cover Suzuki Violin Book 1. Although the games can be adapted to more advanced players, the suggested pieces are only from Book 1.

This site isn't meant to be a replacement for planning but is aimed at jogging a teachers' memory in games they might already know and spark ideas for new games.
